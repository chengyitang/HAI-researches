## Human-Automation Interaction Lab Researches

Academic Advisor: Professor Shih-Yi Chien

### Core Research Focus
My research investigates Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Human-Automation Interaction, focusing on how robotic systems influence human decision-making and consumer behavior through neurophysiological and computational approaches.

### Key Research Areas
1. Robot Recommender Systems & Consumer Behavior

- Examined how robot recommendation systems affect impulse buying behavior
- Used EEG neurophysiological analysis to understand cognitive processes
- Found that marketing strategies and robot recommendations trigger different brain activities

2. Human-Robot Collaboration & Decision-Making

- Assessed decision-making processes in human-robot teams using cost-effective EEG technology
- Investigated the impact of robot capability levels and individual computational thinking abilities
- Analyzed trust calibration and reliance behaviors through brain wave patterns

3. HRI Research Trends Analysis

- Applied machine learning (Deep Nonnegative Autoencoder) to analyze HRI research trends from 2010-2021
- Identified five dominant research topics: handover, privacy, robot tutors, skin deformation, and trust
- Revealed the evolution of technical and human-centered aspects in HRI research

### Methodological Innovation

- Interdisciplinary Integration: Combining neuroscience, computer science, psychology, and business applications
- Low-cost EEG Systems: Utilizing Lego-like EEG headsets for accessible neurophysiological research
- Multi-modal Analysis: Integrating objective physiological measures, subjective assessments, and behavioral data

### Research Impact
My work contributes to understanding cognitive mechanisms in human-automation interaction and provides insights for designing more effective and trustworthy robotic systems in commercial and educational contexts.
